drinkDescriptions = ["Description: A simple and smooth coffee, the Americano is made by adding hot water to a shot of espresso, resulting in a drink that retains espresso’s bold flavor but with a lighter, more diluted texture. It’s perfect for those who enjoy black coffee with a milder intensity.",
                     "Description: A classic Italian favorite, cappuccino is made with one-third espresso, one-third steamed milk, and one-third milk foam. This creates a beautifully layered drink that is rich and creamy while still allowing the bold espresso flavor to shine through.",
                     "Description: A Starbucks trademark, the frappuccino is a blended iced coffee made with brewed coffee or espresso, milk, sugar, and ice. Often topped with whipped cream and flavored syrups, it’s a sweet, creamy, and refreshing beverage.",
                     "Description: Made popular through social media, dalgona coffee is a whipped coffee drink where instant coffee, sugar, and hot water are beaten into a fluffy foam and then served over cold or hot milk. It’s rich, velvety, and visually appealing.",
                     "Description: Similar to an Americano but with the preparation reversed, a long black is made by pouring espresso over hot water. This method preserves the crema (golden foam) on top, giving it a richer taste and slightly stronger aroma compared to an Americano.",
                     "Description: Meaning 'stained' or 'marked' in Italian, a macchiato is an espresso topped with just a small dollop of foamed milk. It balances the intense espresso flavor with a slight creaminess, making it a great choice for those who enjoy strong coffee with a hint of milk.",
                     "Description: A cortado consists of equal parts espresso and warm milk, creating a well-balanced drink that reduces the acidity of espresso without overwhelming it with milk. It’s smooth, creamy, and ideal for those who want a strong coffee with a touch of softness.",
                     "Description: A ristretto is a short and concentrated shot of espresso made with less water. This results in a richer, bolder, and slightly sweeter coffee compared to a regular espresso, as it highlights the most flavorful compounds in the coffee beans.",
                     "Description: A delightful fusion of coffee and dessert, affogato is made by pouring a shot of hot espresso over a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The contrast between the hot coffee and cold ice cream creates a deliciously creamy and bittersweet treat.",
                     "Description: Originating from Greece, frappé is a foamy, iced coffee made by blending instant coffee, sugar, cold water, and ice. It’s a strong and frothy drink, commonly enjoyed as a refreshing pick-me-up on hot days.",
                     "Description: For those who need an extra caffeine boost, the red eye combines a shot of espresso with a cup of regular drip coffee. This results in a highly caffeinated drink that maintains the full-bodied flavor of brewed coffee with an espresso kick.",
                     "Description: A warm, boozy delight, Irish coffee blends hot brewed coffee with Irish whiskey and sugar, then tops it with a layer of thick whipped cream. It’s a comforting and slightly sweet coffee cocktail, perfect for chilly days or after-dinner indulgence."]
